// 1.Create a variable called sentence. The value of the variable should be a string that contains the words “not” and “bad”. For example, “The movie is not that bad, I like it”.
// 2.Create a variable called wordNot where it’s value is the first appearance of the substring “not” (from the sentence variable).
// 3.Create a variable called wordBad where it’s value is the first appearance of the substring “bad” (from the sentence variable).
// 4.If the word “bad” comes after the word “not”, you should replace the whole “not…bad” substring with “good”, then console.log the result.
// For example, the result here should be : “The movie is good, I like it”
// 5.If the word “bad” does not come after “not” or the words are not in the sentence, console.log the original sentence.


let sentence = "The movie is not that bad, I like it";
let wordNot = "not";
let wordBad = "bad";


let noti = sentence.indexOf(wordNot);
let badi = sentence.indexOf(wordBad);
let badiLen = wordBad.length;

console.log("noti", noti, " badi",badi);

if (noti < badi && noti !== -1) {

    console.log( `${sentence.substring(0,noti)} good ${sentence.substring((badi + badiLen))}`);
} else {
    console.log("The movie is not that bad, I like it");
}
